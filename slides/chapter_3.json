    "question": "A child stops interrupting in class after the teacher ignores disruptive comments but praises polite participation. Which process best explains this change?",
    "options": [
      "Negative punishment removing attention for interruptions.",
      "Positive reinforcement strengthening polite behavior.",
      "Extinction of the disruptive response through withdrawal of reinforcement.",
      "Negative reinforcement reducing teacher control."

    "question": "Which statement most accurately differentiates operant learning from respondent learning?",
    "options": [
      "Operant learning depends on associations between stimuli and involuntary responses.",
      "Operant learning occurs through consequences that modify voluntary behavior.",
      "Respondent learning involves conscious decision-making guided by rewards.",
      "Respondent learning uses reinforcement schedules to control frequency of actions."

    "question": "A factory worker is paid for every 10 items assembled, regardless of time. What reinforcement schedule is being used?",
    "options": [
      "Fixed-interval schedule, based on time elapsed.",
      "Fixed-ratio schedule, based on the number of responses.",
      "Variable-interval schedule, based on random timing.",

    "question": "Which of the following scenarios most clearly represents negative reinforcement rather than punishment?",
    "options": [
      "A student is scolded for being late and stops arriving late.",
      "A patient exercises to prevent back pain from returning.",
      "A teen loses phone privileges after missing curfew.",

    "question": "A supervisor increases praise for punctual employees but notices no improvement. Which principle is most likely being violated?",
    "options": [
      "Reinforcement was not contingent on the desired behavior.",
      "Punishment was too inconsistent.",
      "Reinforcement used a fixed-interval schedule instead of variable ratio.",
      "Discriminative stimuli were overused."

  },
  {
    "question": "In operant conditioning, why does variable-ratio reinforcement typically produce the highest response rate?",
    "options": [
      "Because reinforcement is predictable, allowing for rapid responding.",
      "Because reinforcement occurs after varying responses, maintaining high motivation.",
      "Because reinforcement occurs after fixed time intervals, creating anticipation.",
      "Because extinction happens faster under variable schedules."

    "correct_answer": "Because reinforcement occurs after varying responses, maintaining high motivation."

    "question": "A client is taught to complete daily hygiene routines by reinforcing each small step (turning on water, applying soap, rinsing). This is an example of:",
    "options": [
      "Chaining, where sequential behaviors are linked together.",
      "Shaping, where approximations toward the final behavior are reinforced.",
      "Discrimination training using antecedent stimuli.",

  {
    "question": "A therapist wants a client to complete a 3-step coping routine: deep breathing, journaling, and calling a friend. The entire sequence must occur before reinforcement. What technique applies?",
    "options": [
      "Stimulus generalization.",
      "Chaining.",
      "Fixed-interval scheduling.",
      "Positive punishment."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Chaining."

  {
    "question": "Why is behavior learned under intermittent reinforcement more resistant to extinction than behavior learned under continuous reinforcement?",
    "options": [
      "Intermittent schedules make reinforcement unpredictable, reducing dependency on consistent rewards.",
      "Continuous reinforcement creates stronger associations with the stimulus.",
      "Intermittent reinforcement eliminates discriminative stimuli entirely.",
      "Continuous reinforcement prevents spontaneous recovery."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Intermittent schedules make reinforcement unpredictable, reducing dependency on consistent rewards."

    "question": "A student studies only when reminded that grades are released every two weeks. This studying pattern best reflects:",
    "options": [
      "Fixed-interval schedule producing bursts of activity near reinforcement times.",
      "Fixed-ratio schedule creating steady response rates.",
      "Variable-ratio schedule maintaining consistent responding.",
      "Variable-interval schedule eliminating post-reinforcement pauses."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Fixed-interval schedule producing bursts of activity near reinforcement times."
